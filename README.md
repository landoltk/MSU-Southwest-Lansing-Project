This course is a semester long project where you collaborate with an organization. Our community partner is the CCED (Center for Community and Economic Development) and our purpose is to build an open-source tool that can present community data about Southwest Lansing in a user-friendly and understandable way. Our goal is to demonstrate this tool in a way that is comprehensible for non-data scientists. We are exhilarated to be working with the CCED and can't wait for the tool that we will produce.
